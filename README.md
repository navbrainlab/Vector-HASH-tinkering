# Episodic and associative memory from spatial scaffolds in the hippocampus

This is a modified version of  [Episodic and associative memory from spatial scaffolds in the hippocampus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08392-y). , with the main changes being the addition of detailed annotations (including **breakdowns of the meaning of variable dimensions**, etc.), as well as corrections to the original code (for example, some areas lacking definitions, compatibility issues, and so on). In the `.ipynb` file, any modifications to the code cells are clearly marked.
